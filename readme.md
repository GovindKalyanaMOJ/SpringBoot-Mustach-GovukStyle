## Spring Boot  Mustache Govuk Assets Prototype

**Overview**
	Objective of this exercise is to create a prototype to demonstrate how to produce a working spring boot based MVC application utilising
	the mustache template to do server side html generation utilizing govuk-template, govuk-element-sass, govuk_frontend_toolkit.


### Simple Steps to get started

- Clone this repository
- Run the application as one would do with any spring boot application
- Access the local host on port 8080 (if you have not changed any defaults)
- You can build your application just by adding your code on top of this and push it into your own git repository.

you can view an application with header, menu links, footer, and a message with an icon attached to it.
